# Mineral Catalog

# This is a mineral catalog website built in part with HTML and CSS originally supplied from www.teamtreehouse.com for a Python Web Development Tech Degree Project. The HTML and CSS is to be considered built by teamtreehouse for this project(unless otherwise noted), but may be edited by me at some point.

# This is a Django application that will have a database containing information about various minerals. The user of the Django site will be able to look at the details of any mineral the user choices to view. The user can also go to a random mineral's page.
